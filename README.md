This is a public repository for the package "HaploMapper". This package takes molecular data which is paired with historical gene infromation and trains machine learning algorythems to produce predictive haplotype calls for lines which are genotyped with high density molecular platforms, yet not genotyped for the specific locus/QTL/gene in question.
