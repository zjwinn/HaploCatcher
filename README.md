This is a public repository for the R package 'HaploCatcher'. This package utilizes genome-wide molecular data, paired with historical locus/QTL/gene information, to train machine learning algorithms to produce predictive haplotype calls for lines which are genotyped with high density molecular platforms, yet not genotyped for the specific locus/QTL/gene in question. Any questions related to development, maintenance, and potential errors can be directed to: Dr. Zachary J. Winn [zwinn@outlook.com].
