![This is a public repository for the package "HaploCatcher". This package utilizes genome-wide molecular data, paired with historical locus/QTL/gene information, to train machine learning algorithms to produce predictive haplotype calls for lines which are genotyped with high density molecular platforms, yet not genotyped for the specific locus/QTL/gene in question.
